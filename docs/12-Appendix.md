## Hypothes.is

For this coursebook I have implemented an annotation tool - Hypothes.is - so that you can highlight or add comments to any of the text.

[Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) is a web-based open annotation tool. Hypothes.is allows us to collaboratively markup a document so that anyone on the web can see the annotations. Think of this as a layer that sits on top of a webpage. But, since we don't want everyone on the web to see our class's discussion, I've also created a private group which takes a few extra steps to join. Here are the directions:

1. [Create an account on hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/signup) You can use your uw.edu email address to do this.
2. Once you have created an account use the following link to join our class's private group: https://hypothes.is/groups/xQNP98EB/lis-598-dc2-2020
3. If you go to a published chapter in the coursebook you will now see that any time you select text you have two options - Annotate or Highlight.

4. The first time you attempt to create an annotation you will be asked to login to the hypothesis client.

5. After you login you can select our private coursegroup from a dropdown menu. Note you have to join the group before this will appear to you in the dropdown menu.

6. Once you've selected our private group any annotation you create will only be displayed to a member of our group. Here is an example:

Additional tips:

- All annotations created with hypothes.is also have a unique link. This means that you can share annotations or refer to them in other places. For example, the image above showing my annotation in Chapter 3 can also be found [here](https://hyp.is/gEwxjHwIEeqzMG8LvDfBOw/nniiicc.github.io/LIS-598-DC2-Sp2020/tables-trees-and-triples.html). To find the link for any annotation go to the link icon at the bottom of your annotation.  

- If you don't want to see highlighted annotations in the text you can simply click on the "eye" icon and this will hide any annotations as you read.
