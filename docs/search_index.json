I usually put a note in my syllabus that says something along the lines of “…coursework occasionally needs to come second in your life. All of us have commitments that exceed the expectation of being online and engaged each week, and I don’t expect you to be operating at 100% engagement each day.” Even this qualification seems out of touch given the current climate we are operating in for the Spring 2020 quarter. There will be demands on your time, attention, emotions, and cognitive ability to engage with substantive material over the next 10 weeks. There are many unknowns that we are each managing. I have relaxed my own personal expectations for this quarter, and I encourage you all to do the same. This doesn’t mean that I will give anything short of 100% effort to delivering a high quality course, but lets operate with a healthy and charitable amount of good will towards each other and towards ourselves for the next 10 weeks. I encourage you all to read my colleague Anna Hoffman’s very personal and incredibly eloquent take on the challenges that we face in the quarter that lies ahead. Here is my adjusted plan to help us navigate the next 10 weeks: Accessability I have created this book in place of a traditional course site hosted on canvas. I am doing this so I can provide most of the text for what are typically lectures (audio and slides) in a form of written chapters. This makes skimming and digesting the material much easier, and will provide a sustainable resource that you can return to at any time in the future. This book will be downloadable, and all of the course content will remain sustainably accessible to you in the future. I will provide a short and hopefully helpful lecture each week, but the majority of the substantive content I am trying to create for the course will be in the form of written chapters. On a week to week basis circumstances may change for how and when you are able to access course materials. I am attempting to provide PDFs where possible of all the readings that are assigned. These will not require you to have any kind of remote VPN or UW affiliated credentials to access. If you cannot, for any reason, access course materials please be in touch and I will attempt to fix the issue as soon as possible. Reduced workload and expectations for engagement I will not use any form of participation in determining your final grade. It is unfortunate, but also unrealistic that we can engage in forum discussions the way that I typically design this course to run. We will still have that opportunity, but keep in mind that I do not expect that your weekly contribution or calculate this into your final mark. The project that makes up a substantive amount of work at the conclusion of this quarter will have some examples from previous courses. I do not expect that you are striving to equal the depth or scope of content that student’s in previous courses have had the freedom to execute. See my previous comment about relaxing expectations and demands of ourselves - this doesn’t mean that we should give anything less than what we are capable - but our capabilities are, collectively, diminished this quarter. Maximum flexibility Everything in this class is negotiable. That applies to grades, assignments, and any course content. Be in touch when and where you need to negotiate any part of this course, and I can promise you I will be as flexible within the constraints of the University as is possible. Assignments have an expected or priority deadline, but these are not hard deadlines. You can turn in assignments at any time throughout the quarter and I will provide feedback as is necessary for you to understand and contextualize the goal of the assignment. I have two requests related to this policy: Please make an earnest effort to keep up with work. I don’t know how to design a course (and I’m not sure it is even possible) that doesn’t take advantage of progressive knowledge gain. Meaning - practice or exercise in one week can be the baseline for starting an assignment the next week. There will undeniably be moments where this isn’t possible - but give it your best effort. Please try to communicate when a priority deadline is not realistic for you to meet (My email is nmweber@uw.edu). This can be in advance or after a deadline has passed. You do not need to explain why. If you are falling behind and I havent’t had have any communication from you I may reach out with an email. Please don’t interpret this as any form of pressure other than my expressing a concern. 1.2 How this class is organized There are two sections of this class. The first section (weeks 1-4) follows the typical structure of an iSchool online course. The second section of the class (weeks 5-10) includes lectures and readings, but the major focus of your work is executing a final project. Practically the two sections of the course breakdown as follows: Weekly content Week 1-4: each week or module within the course consists of, at minimum four components: 1. Readings (required and optional); 2. Written chapters; 3. Recorded lectures; 4. Open discussion. Readings are meant to reinforce concepts and offer practical applications or extensions of the concept / topic we are discussing each week. Written explanations act like an informal textbook chapter. They are an extended narrative where I attempt to explain, define, and introduce concepts related to data curation. You should read these thoroughly - but also feel free to return to these as a reference resource in the future. Short lecture reinforce important points from the chapter and provide an opportunity to present more dynamic content. Where possible I will provide links to slides that are used, and all lectures will be accessible as an MP4 that you can view on any device or with any program of your choosing. Open discussions have two forms - you can participate in a Canvas discussion with your colleagues (I have created a discussion thread for each of week of class), and I will host an open office hour each week. I’ll record these via Zoom so that if you are not able to attend you can see what was discussed. Exercises Week 1-4: Each week I will post an exercise that asks you to engage with open data. This might include restructuring a dataset, using a tool, or practicing some skill that is applicable to our weekly topic. A list of exercises are found below. Weekly content Week 5-10: In the second section of this class each week will include: 1. Readings (required and optional); 2. Written chapters; and 3. Recorded lectures. The difference is that in weeks 5-10 you will meet with me (or check-in via email) about steps taken to complete your final assignment. This provides an opportunity for you to work with me more directly - asking questions or clarifications - in exercises. I will work with you or your group to schedule a convenient time to meet each week. Protocol Assignments Week 5-10: Each week I will post an exercise that you or your group are to complete in advance of our meeting. This will become clearer as the quarter moves along - but just keep in mind that your exercises or assignments in the second section of the class are in service of a final project. 1.3 Weekly Overview Week Topic Readings Exercises Chapter Lecture 0 Class Introduction None Read Syllabus 0 1 Tables, Trees, and Triples Cookie Recipes 2 Tidy Data Tidy cookie data 3 Data Integration 311 data 4 Data Packaging Data Packegr 5 Human Factors in Data Curation 6 Data Acquisition, Search, and Discovery 7 Metadata Application Profiles 8 Ontologies and Linked Data 9 Emerging Topics 1.4 Grades Exercises: Weeks 1-4 have a practical exercise component that asks you to apply some concept that is covered in the Chapter or Lecture. You need to complete these by following the directions in each exercise. Completing each exercise is a credit / no-credit mark. Give an earnest effort and you will receive credit. (40% of your final grade) Protocol Assignments: Weeks 5-10 has a protocol related assignment that is due each week. If you complete these before our weekly meetings I can give you feedback and help you structure these so that they are useful to you. You only need to complete these by including them in your final protocol deliverable. (20% of your final grade) Protocol: The final assignment that is due on or before June 06 2020 - The assignment is described in detail in another section. In short, the assignment asks you to envision curating and archiving a set of open data that are topically relevant. The final protocol can be turned in a variety of formats, but must include all of the components described on the assignment page to be given full credit. (40% of your final grade) "]
