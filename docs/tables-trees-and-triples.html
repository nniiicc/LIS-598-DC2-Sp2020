<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Introduction</h3>
<p>Susan Leigh Starr once famously wrote that “Information science is the study of boring things..”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> She meant this in loving way. As a field of practitioners and researchers we’re concerned with the organizaiton and encoding of information, as well as the standards and practices that govern reliable knowledge production. This requires us to study and become versant in particular “boring” details of how information is represented within broader information systems and infrastructures. An information infrastructure is, by Starr’s account, highly relational. Information and infrastructures mean different things to different people at different points in time. Data is no different. In fact, there is a soundbite that you may come across in the data curation community that goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One person’s metadata is another person’s data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this quote is getting at is the exactly what Starr meant by the relational nature of information and infrastructure. That is, all data are contextual - they mean different things to different people at different points in time. The definition of data that we use in DC I and II recognizes this through the idea of types and roles: Data are types of information objects playing the role of evidence. The role of evidence will be contextually dependent upon who is using what data, when, and for what purpose<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Given the fundamental relational nature of data we should start the course off by thinking about how to make decisions about ways data should be represented and made accessible to users. Because, if we accept that choices we make in how to structure, represent, and format data in turn shape access and use then there must be some guiding principles, or at least an explanation that helps us make sense of these different choices. Indeed, there are a many different paradigmatic ways to approach the relational nature of data. My mentor Allen Renear, along with Elizabeth Wickes and Andrea Thomer, have nicely summarized this data concept as being about the abstractions afforded by using “Tables, Trees, or Triples”. This first chapter unpacks some of their ideas and helps frame our course.</p>
</div>
<div id="levels-of-abstraction" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Levels of abstraction</h3>
<p>Let’s begin with an anecdote about a “thing” or an “instance” of a thing that is made into data.</p>
<p>An ecology graduate student sitting in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest biome observes a species of a frog. Not just any frog, an <a href="https://amphibiaweb.org/species/3299">Adenomera</a> of the genus leptodactylid. She makes a mark of the observation in her field notebook. A while later she observes another Adenomera. She makes a similar mark in her field notebook. But, now she also makes a third mark - observing the pattern dispersion in a 4x4 meter box where the observations occur. She further records some metadata that includes the lattitude and longitude of the observations, as well as the time of her observations.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The data that our intrepid ecology graduate student has collected is made portable by her taking the field notebook back to her lab, and entering the data into a computer. But, she has a decision to make: How should she enter that data in her computer? Should she open an Excel sheet and begin structuring the data into rows and columns? Should she fire up MySQL and create a new database table? Maybe she is in a hurry and simply wants to write up her fieldnotes in a plain text file and go have a beer.</p>
<p>The choices she makes in this brief instance are what transforms her observations from the <strong>conceptual level</strong> of “a thing that happened in the world” to the <strong>logical level</strong> of how data that are structured with a standard, or non-standard schema. Our computers further abstract this data into a <strong>physical level</strong> where the data are <em>encoded</em> or made machine interpretable as files, and bits (1s and 0s) written to a disk.</p>
<p>These three levels - the conceptual, logical, and physical - are all related to the idea of abstraction. We abstract away from the messiness of the conceptual world by using logic that structures information in physical storage and retrieval hardware. The choices made at the logical level will have profound consequences for later reuse. And while our ecology graduate student has many choices available to her (will she or will she not go have that beer?) at the logical level of data representation her choices typically break down into three categories: Tables, trees, or triples.</p>
</div>
<div id="tables" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Tables</h3>
<p>The idea of a ‘table’ comes from the Edgar Codd’s relational data model (1967) where first-order predicate logic is used to express ordered lists of related instances (tables), as well as relations between tables (the database).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In this way, tables give structure to data through a column (an attribute), a row (an observed instance) and a value (the data represented as a number, text string, category, etc.). The power of the relational approach to structuring data is that we can store large amounts of information, and depend on querying syntax to retrieve subsets or “views” of the data. End users don’t need to know anything about data at the physical level, they only need to know enough about the logical representation of the data (some attributes) in order to find what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>Most of the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that provide access to information in our lives - from mobile apps to library catalogues - are driven by databases that further hide this logical model from end users. We don’t need to know anything about the schema in Zappos’ database to know that if we select <code>brand - converse</code> and <code>color-black</code> and <code>size-7.5</code> we can locate our new Chuck Taylor All Stars for summer.</p>
<p>Excel - and before that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3">Lotus 1-2-3</a> - are undeniably the most interesting mix of a graphical user interface and a database that allows us to easily create tables of information (or spreadsheets) that mirror the relational model of data management. While Excel doesn’t easily facilitate the linking of tables to one another, it still gives us the structuring power of the table in terms of columns, rows, and values. And like a database this allows end users to abstract away from the physical level of data storage.</p>
<p>What tables are good for is obvious - They help provide a structure for related observations or instances of a thing. But, tables are not well suited for expressing logical structures that go beyond simple observed instances. A simpler way to put that is a database, in being based on a rigid first-order predicate logic, doesn’t handle nuance well.</p>
</div>
<div id="trees" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.4</span> Trees</h3>
<p>A declarative markup language is quite literally built for expressing nuance. Charles Goldfarb in 1981 developed the notion of a descriptive markup language that could, in ways similar to the relational data model, allow for complex information to be expressed at the logical level, but not require that users know anything about physical storage. A markup language, like HTML or XML, structures data in a hierarchical fashion. It depends upon a schema - which defines an element or tag set - and the application of tags to give structure to our data (values).</p>
<p>A markup language can therefore express complex relationships through its schema and structuring of information. And this logic - the hierarchy that will be defined by our schema - in turn allows physical levels of information storage that are, relatively, efficient at retrieving complex information.</p>
<p>Let’s use an example from William Blake’s poem ‘The Sick Rose’ from the anthology ‘Songs of Experience’</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Songs_of_innocence_and_of_experience%2C_page_39%2C_The_Sick_Rose_%28Fitzwilliam_copy%29.png/800px-Songs_of_innocence_and_of_experience%2C_page_39%2C_The_Sick_Rose_%28Fitzwilliam_copy%29.png" /></p>
<p>Our computers can easily render this JPG, but they cannot easily process or make sense of the data of this poem (stanzas, lines, or words). Putting this type of information into a database also doesn’t make a sense. What would we even call an attribute, or a value of this instance?</p>
<p>Writing an XML schema that defines properties of Blake’s work - like anthology, poem, stanza, and line - will allow us to create a structured data representation of the poem that can be easily be stored and retrieved at the physical level.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;anthology&gt; 
  &lt;poem&gt;       
    &lt;heading&gt;The SICK ROSE&lt;/heading&gt;       
    &lt;stanza&gt;           
      &lt;line&gt;O Rose thou art sick.&lt;/line&gt;           
      &lt;line&gt;The invisible worm,&lt;/line&gt;         
      &lt;line&gt;That flies in the night&lt;/line&gt;         
      &lt;line&gt;In the howling storm:&lt;/line&gt;       
    &lt;/stanza&gt;          
    &lt;stanza&gt;           
      &lt;line&gt;Has found out thy bed&lt;/line&gt;           
      &lt;line&gt;And his dark secret love&lt;/line&gt;        
      &lt;line&gt;Does thy life destroy.&lt;/line&gt;      
    &lt;/stanza&gt;
  &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;!-- more poems go here --&gt;
&lt;/anthology&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The XML tree provides for relations between data both through the schema, and through the syntax. An anthology contains a poem, a poem contains stanzas, and stanzas contain lines. Each indentation in the above XML nests these elements further inside one another. This is what creates the “hierarchy” that our computers interpret as a tree.</p>
<p>The tag that closes the poem and contains a note <code>&lt;!-- more poems go here --&gt;</code> is important. This hints at the idea that we can add more poems with more lines to the anthology markup by simply using the pre-defined schema. So, similar to a table we have the ability through logic to relate data to one another, but we also gain the ability to use the syntax and nesting to further refine and express relationships between data that are hierarchical. The ability to express relationships in structured text is what makes a hierarchical form like a tree so valuable for publishing electronic content.</p>

<div id="data-independence" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.5</span> Data Independence</h3>
<p>What I’ve been describing in the tables and trees sections thus far - this idea of abstracting away from physical storage to a logical level of data structuring - is the concept of <strong>Data Independence</strong>.</p>
<p>By organizing data at a logical level, either through relations or element sets based on a pre-defined schema, we can easily add new data or new relations without having to rewrite our entire database system (or our XML schema). That is, data independence is the ability to present the stored information (at the physical level) in different ways to different users. So we can offload the organization and structure to a general schema, and we can then build rich graphic user interfaces that display the data any way we choose. Data independence also means that we can easily modify and update applications that depend on this structured schema, and minimally impact end-users that interact with a graphic user interface. Both tables and trees make this logical level data independence possible, and allow data to grow (or scale) more or less infinitely.</p>
<p>The following image depicts the relationship between the concepts we’ve been talking about thus far. Note that a separation between the logical level and the conceptual level is what enables data independence. The logical level practically has three areas where, as data curators, we manage different aspects of our users experience. At the schema level we define the logical representation and relationship between data, at the data level we manage information, create and edit metadata, and provide documentation, and at the user interface we provide data to end users (in this picture, as a drop down menu).</p>

<div id="trees-and-tables" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.6</span> Trees and Tables</h3>
<p>You may have left the last section thinking to yourself, “If the syntax of a markup language affords us so much expressive power, why not use a markup language like XML for all data?”</p>
<p>What we gain expressive power from a markup language comes at the expense of computational tractability. The more syntax we have to write to define how and where a set of data are interpreted by our computers at the physical level, the more difficult and expensive it will be to retrieve that data.</p>
<p>This tradeoff can be made a bit clearer if we look at the differences between the two most widely used notation systems for structured data: JSON (javascript object notation<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>) and XML (extensible markup langauge<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>)</p>
<p>XML, or a hierarchical tree like structure of data, depends on nesting element sets within one another (these were the indentations in our Blake XML). If we want to represent these same elements in a stream - that is in something that our computers can efficiently retrieve as a list or dictionary - JSON is better suited to this task than a markup language. This is, partially, because JSON is based on a programming language not a markup standard. JSON treats an object as <em>independent</em> from any kind of semantic meaning that humans might reliably expect that object to have. JSON, in its syntactical structuring of data, is therefore able to achieve a kind of independence at the data level that XML cannot. But removing this semantic (or contextual) meaning has both affordances and limitations. By keeping data objects “independent” from the schema we have the ability compute against (that is retrieve, reorder, and analyze) objects efficiently. But, we also lose the ability to embed meaning in the structure of our data.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>This will make more sense by looking at how the two different notation systems structure the same information. For our example, let’s use Homer Simpson and his relatives.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In JSON we could represent Homer’s familial relations with a list in the following way:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Homer&quot;,
    &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Simpson&quot;,
    &quot;relatives&quot;: [ &quot;Grandpa&quot;, &quot;Marge&quot;, &quot;The Boy&quot;, &quot;Lisa&quot;, &quot;I think that&#39;s all of them&quot; ]
}</code></pre>
<p>The same information, when represented in a markup language like XML (which follows a tree-like hierarchical form), looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Person&gt;
    &lt;FirstName&gt;Homer&lt;/FirstName&gt;
    &lt;LastName&gt;Simpsons&lt;/LastName&gt;
    &lt;Relatives&gt;
        &lt;Relative&gt;Grandpa&lt;/Relative&gt;
        &lt;Relative&gt;Marge&lt;/Relative&gt;
        &lt;Relative&gt;The Boy&lt;/Relative&gt;
        &lt;Relative&gt;Lisa&lt;/Relative&gt;
        &lt;Relative&gt;I think that&#39;s all of them&lt;/Relative&gt;
    &lt;/Relatives&gt;
&lt;/Person&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Practically, we can think about how we would retrieve data from these two representations of the same information, and the efficiency of our computers to do so.</p>
<p>Just looking at the syntax we can see that JSON is more computationally efficient. There are fewer lines of encoded information and fewer assignments of our computer’s memory to represent the same information. In JSON we can represent all of the relatives in a simple list, and then use the order of that list to retrieve any member (e.g. <code>&gt; Relatives [4]</code> returns <code>Lisa</code>)</p>
<p>In the XML we represent each family member with a <code>&lt;Relative&gt;</code> tag. In our XML schema we would have defined what the <code>&lt;Relative&gt;</code> tag means and rules that govern its proper use. If we want to retrieve the fourth relative <code>Lisa</code> from this tree our computers have to read each line until it comes to the fourth <code>&lt;Relative&gt;</code> syntax marker, store the value <code>Lisa</code> in our RAM, and then return it to us. This is undeniably a simple retrieval task that won’t overwhelm any sufficiently powered laptop, but we can imagine this getting much more complex and computationally taxing the more data that we have nested in a markup language like XML. Our computers would have to traverse hundreds or thousands of lines of the XML tree to retrieve data that could be simply listed.</p>
<p>But, the tradeoff is that in JSON we don’t have any semantic meaning built into our syntax. In the first JSON example there is no semantic meaning for a string of characters assigned to a list. So we only know something about that list based on the position of any one data object in relation to the entire list. We could quickly retrieve the fourth object in that list, <code>Lisa</code>, but our computer has no meaning for that object - only that it is fourth in the list of objects. XML can use a schema to define each markup tag and how it should be used. To understand this tradeoff issue at scale, let’s represent a bit more data about the Simpsons family in the two notation systems<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In JSON we could represent family members and their ages as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[
 { &quot;lastName&quot; :&quot;Simpson&quot;,
 &quot;firstName&quot; :&quot;Homer&quot;,
 &quot;age&quot; :39
 },
 { &quot;lastName&quot; :&quot;Simpson&quot;,
 &quot;firstName&quot; :&quot;Lisa&quot;,
 &quot;age&quot; :8
 },
 { &quot;lastName&quot; :&quot;Simpson&quot;,
 &quot;firstName&quot; :&quot;Bart&quot;,
 &quot;age&quot; :10
 },
 { &quot;lastName&quot; :&quot;Simpson&quot;,
 &quot;firstName&quot; :&quot;Marge&quot;,
 &quot;age&quot; :36
 },
 { &quot;lastName&quot; :&quot;Simpson&quot;,
 &quot;firstName&quot; :&quot;Maggie&quot;,
 &quot;age&quot; :1
 }
]</code></pre>
<p>In XML, the representation of this information looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&#39;1.0&#39; encoding=&#39;ISO-8859-1&#39;?&gt;
&lt;simpsons:family xmlns:simpsons=&quot;http://training.mulesoft.com/simpsons&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;simpsons:member&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:last-name&gt;Simpson&lt;/simpsons:last-name&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:first-name&gt;Homer&lt;/simpsons:first-name&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:age&gt;39&lt;/simpsons:age&gt;
  &lt;/simpsons:member&gt;
  &lt;simpsons:member&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:last-name&gt;Simpson&lt;/simpsons:last-name&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:first-name&gt;Lisa&lt;/simpsons:first-name&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:age&gt;8&lt;/simpsons:age&gt;
  &lt;/simpsons:member&gt;
  &lt;simpsons:member&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:last-name&gt;Simpson&lt;/simpsons:last-name&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:first-name&gt;Bart&lt;/simpsons:first-name&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:age&gt;10&lt;/simpsons:age&gt;
  &lt;/simpsons:member&gt;
  &lt;simpsons:member&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:last-name&gt;Simpson&lt;/simpsons:last-name&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:first-name&gt;Marge&lt;/simpsons:first-name&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:age&gt;36&lt;/simpsons:age&gt;
  &lt;/simpsons:member&gt;
  &lt;simpsons:member&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:last-name&gt;Simpson&lt;/simpsons:last-name&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:first-name&gt;Maggie&lt;/simpsons:first-name&gt;
    &lt;simpsons:age&gt;1&lt;/simpsons:age&gt;
  &lt;/simpsons:member&gt;
&lt;/simpsons:family&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Again, just looking the two approaches structuring data we can see that JSON is more efficient - there are fewer lines and the data has independence. For example, we could also easily rearrange the data in JSON to simply be two lists:</p>
<pre><code>[
 { &quot;firstName&quot; : [&quot;Homer&quot;, &quot;Lisa&quot;, &quot;Bart&quot;, &quot;Marge&quot;, &quot;Maggie&quot;]
   &quot;age&quot;: [39, 8, 10, 36, 1]
}</code></pre>
<p>But, what XML sacrifices in computational tractability and independence it makes up for in expressivity. Our schema, which is defined in the second line <code>&lt;simpsons:family xmlns:simpsons=&quot;http://training.mulesoft.com/simpsons&quot;&quot;&gt;</code> uses a namespace <code>http://training.mulesoft.com/simpsons</code> to define a class of instances <code>simpsons</code> as well as properties of those instances, such as <code>last-name</code> , <code>first-name</code> and <code>age</code>. This syntax gives us a semantic meaning - our computers don’t just think “this is a member of a list” but instead our computers know “this is an instance of the simpsons class that has the property ‘first-name’ and the value ‘Homer’”</p>
<p>To reiterate something you’re going to get sick of me saying: The tradeoffs in choosing between XML and JSON, or really any logical level data abstraction, are about balancing the need for tractability and expressivity. For textual data that contains many nuances implied in the semantic content, we want to choose something like XML. When we need to privilege fast computation (e.g. retrieval) and data independence then we are more likely to choose something like JSON. Neither approach is right or wrong, but each choice comes at a cost.</p>
</div>
<div id="triples" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.7</span> Triples</h3>
<p>In thinking about differences between tables and trees - we recognize that each has certain affordances and limitations. In describing the affordances of a markup language for trees I stressed it’s “semantic” power by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>our computers don’t just think “this is a member of a list” but instead our computers know “this is a member of the simpsons, that has the property ‘first-name’ and the value ‘Homer’”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that our computers are knowledgeable about the semantic meaning of data, through our notation system, means that we could, in theory, design a system that takes greater advantage of this semantic meaning. At the logical level, if we use a schema to define instances as members of classes, we <em>could</em> also assign properties to those instances. And, by relating those properties to one another, we could start to <strong>know</strong> something about how instances and class membership relate to each other.</p>
<p>In short, this is the ambition of the semantic web - by storing information about objects and instances at the logical level we can build powerful “inferencing systems” that can use logic to reason about the semantic content of our data based on their properties. Where this starts to take a “Eureka!” turn is that by defining a small set of formal logical relationships our computers can start to infer (without explicit direction) relationships that should exist between instances and classes based on their properties.</p>
<p>For example, if we know that <code>Lisa</code> is the daughter of <code>Homer</code> and we create a logical rule that all daughters identify as <code>gender:woman</code> and that all <code>daughters: age</code> are necessarily less than <code>father:age</code> then we can reasonably infer some things about Lisa: We know that <code>Lisa</code> is a <code>woman</code> and that, by being the daughter of <code>Homer</code> she is younger in age. And, we know this without having to explicitly state that <code>Lisa is a woman</code> - our computers can simply reason about this relations through the logical statement that “All daughters identify as women, and Lisa is a daughter”</p>
<p>If we also know that <code>Homer</code> has a son <code>Bart</code> we can also infer some more information about both <code>Lisa</code> and <code>Bart</code> : We can infer that <code>Lisa has a brother Bart</code> and transitively <code>Bart has a sister Lisa</code>. We know all of this by defining the logical relationships between sons, daughters, gender identities, fathers, and siblings in our schema.</p>
<p>The natural language expressions that appear above have simple logical syntax that are the basis of a notation language known as “RDF” or the Resource Description Framework. In RDF, a <strong>triple</strong> is the formalization of a natural language statement that consist of three components: 1. Subject; 2. Object; and, 3. Predicate. An example of an RDF triple statement like “Lisa has a brother Bart” contains the <code>subject:Lisa</code>, the <code>object:Bart</code>, and the <code>predicate:has_a-brother</code>. In an RDF schema, we could define the logic of a predicate like <code>has_a_brother</code> such that :all brothers are male“, and”all brothers have a sibling“, and”all brothers and sisters share at least one parent“. This declaration in our scehma let’s our computers infer that a statement like”Lisa has a brother Bart&quot; means, without explicitly stating it, that Bart identifies with the gender Male, and that he shares at least one parent with Lisa.</p>
<p>RDF triples, by using logic to define relationships between instances and classes, becomes the most powerful of all three choices we have at the logical level of data representation<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>Do you anticipate a “but…” coming?]. But, creating a logically coherent RDF schema is an incredibly difficult task. Triples, and all of their inferential power, are both computationally expensive to retrieve, and descriptively difficult to create and maintain. The tradeoff that we face between tables, trees, and triples presents a modification to the one I’ve discussed thus far - between tractability and expressiveness. The new tradeoff we have is inference, or intelligence: If we want a logical level data representation that is “artificially intelligent” - that is it can infer without explicit directions - then we have to sacrifice some expressivity and a lot of tractability.</p>
<p>We will return to the concept of the Semantic Web and RDF in the 9th week of class, but its helpful to have this logical level data reprenseation in mind as we work through the quarter. In part, because RDF and the Semantic Web are an emergent way of curating data to provide meaning for end users. At the same time, the Semantic Web has been “five years away” since 1998.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.8</span> Summary</h3>
<p>In this chapter I introduced a number of concepts. Here’s a brief review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Levels of abstraction. These include a separation between how we represent data in terms of concepts, logic, and physical storage (See Figure 1 for a quick overview).</li>
<li>Data Independence is the ability to separate data encodings from the logical level where it is managed and made accessible to users. By making data independent from its storage we can easily modify, and add data at the logical level.</li>
<li>Notation languages, such as XML, JSON, and RDF all have tradeoffs. In DC 1 we described these tradeoffs in terms of expressivity and tractability. In DC 2 we introduce the idea of “intelligence” to data representation, but we hold this at arms length because it comes at such a high curation cost.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Exercise</h2>
<p>Chances are if you are living under quarantine (Spoiler: We all are!) you have taken up a new hobby to preoccupy yourself. Maybe this is something productive like knitting or pilates. Maybe it is something like baking sourdough bread (Spoiler: So is the rest of the internet!).</p>
<p>In preparation for our class on <code>Tidy Data</code> next week we will attempt to add some structure to a rather innocuous piece of information that is published to the web and that you’re likely to be encountering with your new found quarantine hobby: Chocolate Chip Cookie recipes.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://d3vjjov8ymzzxi.cloudfront.net/chefsteps-com-files/chefsteps-cookie-table.pdf">infographic</a> from ChefSteps provides a “parametric” explanation of different approaches to making a chocolate chip cookie.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Your excercise for this week is to look at the infographic, choose one cookie, and create a table for that cookie’s recipe.</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide how you would structure the information in this graphic so that it could be interpretable in a table form. (Rows, Columns, and Values)</li>
<li>Each cookie has set of attributes and values that could follow a schema. You don’t have to create the schema this week, just focus on structuring a recipe for a single cookie.</li>
<li>There is already a good deal of structure to this data, but there are some very strange and confusing choices in the values that will complicate this activity. Take note of those.</li>
<li>On the canvas forum, share your table with us, and explain what was easy or hard about creating the table. You can share the table in whatver form you like (create one directly in Canvas, link to a Google Doc, Upload an Excel file, etc.)</li>

As we come to the conclusion of the quarter I’ll try to reemphasize places where readings, discussions, and lectures have provided helpful ways to toggle back and forth from the immediate “boring” details of data curation, and the broader conceptual settings where these “boring things” become salient.<a href="tables-trees-and-triples.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn4"><p>A bit of background on Codd’s model: The relational database was born out of necessity. In the late 1960’s as governments and businesses started to move much of their data gathering into a digital (or qusi-digital) form for computers to interact with there were many idiosyncratic ways of doing so. Each different way depended upon the computing environments, and the organizations that were storing data. To a computer scientist this was chaos. And to Edgar Codd there was a simple and elegant solution: Tables. The relational model for database management is a structure and language consistent with first-order predicate logic - it conceives of <code>tuples</code> (ordered lists of data) grouped into relations. In short, the relational model is “a declarative method for specifying data and queries: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it, and let the database management system software take care of describing data structures for storing the data and retrieval procedures for answering queries.” In other words, a user should simply structure the data (tuples) in terms of rows and columns, and use a simple logic to declare how those rows and columns relate to one another.
