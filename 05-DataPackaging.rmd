# Data Packaging

**Overview**: As data grow in size, and the documentation, software, and dependencies of an operating system grow in complexity, it is becoming increasingly hard to access data without a conceptual "package" to do so. In this week we're going to think about how both the metaphor and the practical application of "packaging" impacts data curation work. This is very much an emerging topic so if it seems like a somewhat fuzzy idea - that is because it absolutely is... But, my hope is that thinking through data packaging will also help us begin to see how and why our work in developing metadata for data curation is paramount to sustainable access. The readings this week reflect the emergence of this topic. I would like you to choose one of the standards I've listed to do some reading of technical documentation.

## Exercise
This week there is no assignment to turn in. Instead we are going to look at a tool `Data Curator` that allows us to describe, validate, and package data using a graphic user interface.
- The tool is available for download here: https://github.com/ODIQueensland/data-curator/releases/tag/v1.0.0
- The dataset that I used in this demonstration is found here: https://data.cityofchicago.org/FOIA/FOIA-Request-Log-Human-Resources/7zkx-3pp7
- After you download DataCurator and the dataset follow along with the following demo video [here](w)
