# Repository Architectures 

This week we are going to focus on the underlying infrastructures and the technical architecture of facilitating data access, sharing, and reuse. We begin with data repositories as a software layer that interacts with hardware configurations to manage, preserve, and facilitate access to shared data collections. Over the last three decades the repository software landscape has grown from a small number of hard to use proprietary repositories to a diverse range of (slightly easier to use) open-source options.

**Required**

Read this very brief description of digital libraries (cyberinfrastructure) from the National Science Foundation program launched in the mid 1990. It provides a nice and very brief description of how data repositories have emerged from early digital library funding: https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/cyber/digitallibraries.jsp 

Now, let's fast forward to a current landscape of many different repository software platforms available. The following post from the IQSS staff at Harvard's Dataverse provides an excellent table comparing existing data repository services. Pay attention to the categories being compared, and how this related to the affordances of the software (also see the 'optional readings' section for more literature like this): https://dataverse.org/blog/comparative-review-various-data-repositories

Next, read this "overly honest" report from the University of Illinois Library (the largest circulating academic library in the world) on developing a data repository:
